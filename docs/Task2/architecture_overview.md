## Key Architectural Decisions

### Task 2.1: Adaptive Connection Management

**Design Decisions:**
- **Dynamic Limits**: MaxOutstandingBytesPerPeer scales from 256KB to 100MB based on load
- **Worker Scaling**: Auto-scales from 128 to 2048 workers based on system performance
- **Adaptation Interval**: 30-second minimum between configuration changes to prevent oscillation
- **Load Factor Calculation**: Weighted average of response time (30%), P95 time (30%), outstanding requests (20%), and RPS (20%)

**Key Components:**
- `AdaptiveBitswapConfig`: Central configuration management with thread-safe operations
- `AdaptiveConnectionManager`: Per-peer connection tracking and limit enforcement
- `ConnectionInfo`: Detailed per-peer metrics and performance tracking

### Task 2.2: Request Prioritization System

**Design Decisions:**
- **Four Priority Levels**: Critical (<10ms), High (<50ms), Normal, Low
- **Separate Worker Pools**: 25%/25%/33%/17% allocation for Critical/High/Normal/Low
- **P95 Monitoring**: Tracks 95th percentile response time for SLA compliance
- **Circular Buffer**: 1000-sample buffer for efficient percentile calculation

**Key Components:**
- `LoadMonitor`: Real-time performance monitoring and metrics collection
- `RequestTracker`: Individual request lifecycle tracking
- `LoadMetrics`: Comprehensive system performance metrics

### Task 2.3: Batch Processing System

**Design Decisions:**
- **Priority-Based Batching**: Separate queues and processing for each priority level
- **Configurable Batch Sizes**: 50-1000 requests per batch based on load
- **Timeout-Based Processing**: 1-100ms timeouts to ensure responsiveness
- **Worker Pool Architecture**: Hierarchical worker pools with panic recovery

**Key Components:**
- `BatchRequestProcessor`: Central batching logic with priority routing
- `WorkerPool`: Full-featured worker pool with auto-scaling and monitoring
- `BatchWorkerPool`: Simplified worker pool for batch-specific tasks
- `BatchProcessorMetrics`: Comprehensive performance tracking
