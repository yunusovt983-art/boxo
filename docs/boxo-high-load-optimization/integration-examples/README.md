## Quick Start

1. **Basic High-Load Cluster:**
```bash
cd docker-compose/basic-cluster
docker-compose up -d
```

2. **Run Performance Benchmarks:**
```bash
cd benchmarking/load-tests
./run-basic-benchmark.sh
```

3. **Access Monitoring Dashboard:**
```bash
# Grafana will be available at http://localhost:3000
# Default credentials: admin/admin
```

## Example Applications

### CDN Service
High-throughput content delivery optimized for large files and many concurrent users.

### Media Streaming
Real-time media streaming with adaptive bitrate and quality optimization.

### IoT Data Hub
High-frequency data ingestion from thousands of IoT devices.

## Docker Deployments

### Basic Cluster
3-node cluster with basic high-load optimizations suitable for development and testing.

### Production Setup
Multi-node production cluster with load balancing, monitoring, and high availability.

### Development Environment
Single-node setup optimized for development with debugging tools enabled.

## Performance Testing

### Load Tests
Comprehensive load testing scenarios covering various usage patterns.

### Stress Tests
Extreme load conditions to test system limits and failure modes.

### Monitoring
Real-time performance monitoring and metrics collection during tests.

## Monitoring and Dashboards

### Grafana Dashboards
Pre-configured dashboards for monitoring Boxo performance metrics.

### Alert Rules
Prometheus alert rules for proactive monitoring and incident response.

### Custom Metrics
Examples of application-specific metrics and monitoring strategies.
